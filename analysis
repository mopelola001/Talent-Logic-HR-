Project Objectives
The primary objective of this analysis is to assess key HR performance metrics for the year 2023. It aims to identify the underlying factors driving employee attrition and to analyse how satisfaction levels influence employee turnover. Additionally, the analysis seeks to gain a comprehensive understanding of demographic and departmental trends that shape employee behaviour. By evaluating employee demographics, compensation structures, satisfaction scores, and departmental distributions, the study aims to identify patterns that influence engagement, income disparity, and overall departmental productivity. Ultimately, the goal is to develop actionable insights that support improved employee retention and foster a more satisfying and productive workplace environment.
